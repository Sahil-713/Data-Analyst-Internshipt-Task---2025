# 🧹 Task 1 – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
**Data Analyst Internship | Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset**

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship. The main goal of this task was to clean and preprocess a raw dataset so it’s ready for analysis or visualization.

I worked with the **Mall Customer Segmentation** dataset, which contains details about customers such as gender, age, income, and spending score.

## 🔧 What I Did  
- Loaded the dataset using **Pandas**
- Checked for **missing values** (none found in this case)
- **Removed duplicate rows**, if any
- **Renamed columns** to be lowercase and more readable
- Cleaned the **'gender'** column by converting all values to lowercase
- Checked and confirmed the **correct data types**
- Saved the cleaned version of the dataset

## 📂 Files Included  
- `Mall_Customers.csv` – Original dataset  
- `Mall_Customers_Cleaned.csv` – Final cleaned dataset  
- `data_cleaning.py` – Python script used for data preprocessing  
- `README.md` – This file  

## ✅ Tools Used  
- Python  
- Pandas Library  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset Source

## 🚀 Outcome  
The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for deeper analysis or modeling. This task helped me get hands-on experience with real-world data cleaning using Python.
